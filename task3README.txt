Use AI to produce a summary of the Northwind Database "Orders" table, focusing on size, date range, key metrics, and trends. Compare the AI output to the human baseline using at least two criteria (accuracy, completeness, bias, reliability). Decide: accept / edit / reject, and explain why

Baseline Summary Example:
Dataset: Northwind Orders table
Size: 830 rows × 14 columns
Key Metrics:
Total orders: 830
Average freight cost: $78.92
Most common ship country: USA
Date range: 1996–1998


Provide explanation below:
Summarize the Northwind Orders table focusing on:

Date range
Key metrics (total orders, average freight cost, most common ship country)
Trends

Accept.
AI output matches baseline for key metrics and adds useful trend insights without introducing bias or errors.
