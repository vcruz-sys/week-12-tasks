In Power Query Editor, clean the data in the file task1-raw.csv so that it meets the following requirements:

Fix Header Row
Ensure the correct row is promoted to headers and that all column names are clean and consistent.

Normalize Data Types
Assign appropriate data types to each column (e.g., text, number, date) so the dataset is properly typed.

Handle Null Values
Identify and address null or missing values as needed (e.g., replace, remove, or transform them based on context).

After you have cleaned the data, convert the data into JSON using Python

For submission:
- Export cleaned data to a data folder and upload to Github:
- Path should look like this
	- /data/clean.csv 
	-/data/export.json
